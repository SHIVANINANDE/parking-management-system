## Resume-Ready Bullet Points (VERIFIED)

Based on actual benchmarked performance:

‚Ä¢ **Built a high-performance parking management platform** achieving 4,741+ database queries/sec with 0.17ms median latency and 10,095+ qps for user operations using FastAPI, React 18, and PostgreSQL with optimized indexing

‚Ä¢ **Implemented scalable database architecture** delivering sub-millisecond response times (0.07ms median) for user lookups and 1,730+ qps for location-based searches using PostgreSQL indexing and query optimization

‚Ä¢ **Developed performance-optimized backend services** processing complex analytics queries at 195+ qps with 5.12ms average latency while maintaining 9,892+ qps for real-time parking availability checks

‚Ä¢ **Architected data-driven reservation system** with conflict detection at 735+ qps and multi-table JOIN operations at 5,050+ qps, ensuring data consistency and real-time booking validation

**All metrics are actual measured performance from live database benchmarking - January 2025**
