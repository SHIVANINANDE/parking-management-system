# Step 5: Real-time Event System - Implementation Complete ✅

## Overview
Successfully implemented a comprehensive real-time event streaming architecture with CQRS pattern, concurrent reservation management, and enterprise-grade performance optimizations for the Smart Parking Management System.

## 🎯 Implementation Summary

### ✅ Event Streaming Architecture
- **Kafka Integration**: Full Kafka producer/consumer setup with dedicated topics
- **Event Sourcing**: Complete audit trail with Event dataclass and EventStore
- **Event Topics**: 
  - `parking-spots` - Spot availability changes
  - `reservations` - Reservation lifecycle events  
  - `payments` - Payment processing events
  - `notifications` - User notifications
  - `user-actions` - User activity tracking
  - `system-events` - System-wide events
- **Redis Event Store**: Persistent event storage with replay capabilities

### ✅ CQRS Pattern Implementation
- **Command/Query Separation**: Complete CQRS with dedicated interfaces
- **Commands**: CreateReservationCommand, UpdateSpotStatusCommand, CancelReservationCommand
- **Queries**: GetAvailableSpotsQuery, GetReservationHistoryQuery, GetUserReservationsQuery
- **Command Results**: Redis-based result tracking with unique IDs
- **Event Integration**: Commands trigger events automatically

### ✅ Concurrent Reservation System
- **Row-Level Locking**: PostgreSQL optimistic concurrency control
- **Distributed Locking**: Redis-based DistributedLock with timeout handling
- **Priority Queuing**: ReservationQueue with priority levels (HIGH, NORMAL, LOW)
- **Atomic Operations**: Database functions for conflict-free reservations
- **Timeout Management**: Automatic reservation cleanup and timeout handling
- **Double-booking Prevention**: Multiple layers of protection

### ✅ Real-time Communication
- **WebSocket Support**: Connection management with user-specific channels
- **Event Broadcasting**: Real-time notifications to connected clients
- **Connection Manager**: Maintains active WebSocket connections
- **Message Templates**: Structured notification formatting

### ✅ Database Integration
- **Migration 004**: Versioning and concurrency control schema
- **Optimistic Concurrency**: Version-based conflict detection
- **Event Store Tables**: Persistent event storage
- **Notification Preferences**: User-specific notification settings
- **System Alerts**: Critical system event tracking
